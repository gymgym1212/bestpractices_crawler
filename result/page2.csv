""Placed in the root of the repository are files that formally describe the coding

.uncrustify.cfg used by clang-format and uncrustify respectively. If you
want to format code automatically, you will need to have at least one of these
tools installed. Since by default, these tools look for the closest style file
located in one of the parent directories or, otherwise, in a default location,
there are a a couple of helpful scripts i.e. ./tools/clang-format.sh and
./tools/uncrustify.sh to assure you that the Kea-owned file is used. They
accept any number of customized parameters that would be passed to the
underlying tool followed by any number of files and/or directories. Passing

Users can opt to download and install a packaged release, or to use the backports infrastructure for direct kernel integration. Both interfaces are documented separately:

https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Documentation/packaging
https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Documentation/integration

The way this works and how this is possible is best documented through the developer documentation:

https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Documentation/backports/hacking

The technical details in more elaborate detail is provided in paper form:

http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/papers/backport_edcc15.pdf",Met,https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git,Met,"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git

All changes go into the git repository. We track the changes, who made the changes, when the changes were made. Other than this we also track who merged the change. We have two key maintainers:

  Hauke Mehrtens
  Luis R. Rodriguez

The repository is shared on kernel.org between both of these maintainers, they coordinate via IRC and e-mail about when one can / should merge changes.",Met,"The project mirrors Linux's own release mechanisms. The project relies on linux-next to generate snapshot releases based on the latest development efforts both on Linux and on the Linux backports project, these are the linux-next based snapshots. Once Linus releases a kernel as a release candidate the backports project follows with a respective release candidate for it. Once Linus blesses a final release a respective backports project follows through with a respective final release.

During the development phase of Linux we have daily linux-next based snapshots, these are dated, the latest one being based on linux-next tag next-20160122, and so the respective backports release is:

https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/2016/01/22/backports-20160122.tar.gz

Packaged releases are also made to mirror Linux stable releases, so for instance we have the v3.10-rc1 release:

https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.10-rc1/

Then the v3.10 final release:

https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.10/

After that we have follow up fixes to upstream Linux, and then a respective backports release for it, there were 3 extra version releases for v3.10:

https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.10.4/
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.10.17/
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.10.19/

If the need ever arises to make a backports release update between the same snapshot of Linux a postfix digit is used to annotate this. For instance, we had two v3.8-rc2 releases, -1 and -2:

https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.8-rc2/compat-drivers-3.8-rc2-1.tar.bz2
https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/backports/stable/v3.8-rc2/compat-drivers-3.8-rc2-2.tar.bz2

",Met,"Git is used:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git/",Met,"The release tags for backports mirror the Linux kernel release scheme. When releases are made based on linux-next, the respective tag is used but instead of ""next"", ""backports"" is used. So for instance, a release based on linux-next next-20160122 would have a tag ""backports-20160122"".

For stable releases the same Linux versioning scheme is followed, starting with release candidates (v3.10-rc1-1, v3.10-rc1-2), to final version (v3.10-1, v3.10-2), to extra version stable updates (v3.10.4-1, v3.10.19-1):

v3.10-1
v3.10-2
v3.10-rc1-1
v3.10-rc1-2
v3.10.17-1
v3.10.17-2
v3.10.19-1
v3.10.4-1

Since this project builds on Linux, we needed a way to distinguish between backport specific releases. This is accounted for the extra dash followed by the release number, so v3.10-1, v3.10-2, both -1 and -2 are backport specific annotations.",Unmet,"The Linux kernel does not make API changes that affect userspace, so there is no need to have denote api compatibility, it is always stable.",Met,"Here's an example release using tag backports-20160122

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git/tag/?h=backports-20160122

Likewise, here's a stable release using tag v4.4.2-1:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git/tag/?h=v4.4.2-1",Met,"Since the backports project mirrors Linux the ChangeLog of Linux is referred to for changes, backport specific updates are too many to list, but major updates are referenced when a release is made, and the respective project README is updated to account for subsystems that are backported. This is available here:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/backports/backports.git/tree/README

When a new device driver is added it is mentioned only in the commit logs, we could do a better job at not only annotating subsystems but also device drivers, this becomes tricky however as we backport over 700 device drivers now. We will discuss what things we can do better to improve on this area.",Met,"The backports project builds on top of Linux, the amount of backports specific code accounts for about 1%-2% of the code used. Although there is a risk of a security issue within backports, the major attack surface consists of non-backports related code: device drivers, or libraries carried over. Security fixes from Linux are carried over, we do not explicitly mirror the changelog of Linux, instead refer people to Linux' own changelog for security fixes on Linux.",?,,Met,"The ""Backports project"" section of bugzilla is used.",Met,"This is documented here:

https://backports.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Reporting-vulnerabilities",Met,We have not had any vulnerabilities reported.,Met,"Since Linux backports mirrors Linux, the build testing / automatic builds are borrowed, so linux-next daily builds are done by IBM, likewise, Intel's 0-day test infrastructure .

https://01.org/lkp

Other than this currently backports build tests are done prior to each release, since all supported kernels need to be tested against, currently 24 kernels need to be compile tested against, compile testing with all features enabled takes a long time. HP, Linux Foundation, and SUSE donated a server to help with this, we grant access to key developers to help build test prior to making a release, or when incorporating a patch to test the build.

We will work on automating builds though this may be a bit complex given the overhead.",Met,"All required tools are free and open source software. The same tools to build Linux are the same tools to build backports Linux releases, with the addition of Coccinelle needed to generate packages for users. Only developers need coccinelle.

make
gcc
python

They have a series of run time tests against the 802.11 Intel wifi driver. This test the 802.11 subsystem and Intel's specific device driver against specific kernels.

Its not okay to not have a generic run time automation test suite, this however is a bit complex though as it would mean testing at run time Linux backports builds on each supported 24 kernels for each release. There is also the issue of needing emulated devices to load and test drivers. This is a major undertaking. Some form of automating run time testing is desirable. As it stands we rely on independent stakeholders to do their own run time testing of supported device drivers. The rest of the drivers are supported as best effort.",Met,,Unmet,"We definitely cannot test all known functions provided.
