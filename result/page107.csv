However cryptographic capabilities are provided for the following:

1) Traffic between Kubernetes Nodes can be encrypted using IPsec. This is provided through Open vSwitch and strongSwan.

2) Control plane communication channels are secured using TLS. This is provided though the standard Go cryptographic libraries. If users do not provide their own certificate and private key, Antrea will ask the Kubernetes apiserver library to generate a certificate / key pair using the Go cryptographic libraries. An RSA key length of 2048 bits will be used.

While the Antrea code uses SHA1, which is vulnerable to attacks, SHA1 is *not* used for cryptography purposes, but is used to generate identifiers.",Met,Antrea relies on strongSwan (https://www.strongswan.org/) and the standard Go cryptography libraries.,Met,"Antrea relies on strongSwan (https://www.strongswan.org/) and the standard Go cryptography libraries, which are FLOSS.",Met,"Antrea ships with a recent version of strongSwan, which uses IKEv2 IPsec connections by default, with the aes128-sha256-modp3072 cipher suite for IKE and the aes128-sha256 cipher suite for ESP, Note that it is possible for user to override the default configuration.
The Pre-Shared Key (PKS) for the IPsec tunnels is provided by the user.

Control plane communications:

 * The Kubernetes apiserver used by the Antrea Controller will by default use TLS 1.2, with a 2048-bit RSA key. The cipher suites used for TLS are the ones implemented by the Go cryptography libraries , excluding the ones with known security issues. The keylengths meet the NIST minimum requirements. Users may elect to provide their own certificate and RSA key for the Antrea Controller. No configuration parameter is provided for users to change the cipher suite used by the Antrea Controller apiserver.

 * For connections from the Antrea components (Agent / Controller) to the Kubernetes apiserver instance, TLS is also used. The cluster administrator is free to configure the Kubernetes apiserver instance (kube-apiserver) as desired, and this is out-of-scope of Antrea. However, Antrea uses client-go (https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) to connect to kube-apiserver, which requires TLS 1.2 or greater and restricts cipher suites to a secure list.",Met,"While the Antrea code uses SHA1 directly, which is vulnerable to attacks, SHA1 is *not* used for cryptography purposes, but is used to generate identifiers. The gosec linter (run as part of CI for every commit) flags direct uses of DES, RC4, MD5 or SHA1 in the Antrea code.

The TLS v1.2 implementation in the standard Go cryptography library does not use broken cryptographic algorithms by default. In particular cipher suites using RC4 are excluded by default. 3DES cipher suites are included.

We use a recent strongSwan version that defaults to the aes128-sha256-modp3072 cipher suite for IKE and the aes128-sha256 cipher suite for ESP. Given that both endpoints are configured by Antrea, these are the cipher suites that should be used, even if the charon daemon may include additional defaults.",Unmet,strongSwan currently does not enforce PFS by default (see https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/SecurityRecommendations#Perfect-Forward-Secrecy-PFS). Antrea should provide an IPsec configuration file that enables PFS.,,All authentication is delegated to the K8s apiserver instance.,Met,"When generating a self-signed certificate-key pair for the Antrea Controller, the K8s apiserver library invokes rsa.GenerateKey from the standard Go cryptography library (https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/rsa/#GenerateKey). The key is generated using a CSPRNG.

Antrea currently does not directly generate cryptographic key / nonces, but if we do, the gosec linter will warn if the ""wrong"" random generator is used (rand instead of crypto/rand).",Met,"Starting with Antrea v0.10.0, all assets are delivered securely, using a combination of the following mechanisms:
