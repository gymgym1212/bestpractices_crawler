8,2582,3460,LinuxTV," The LinuxTV community develops and maintains the Linux Kernel Media Subsystems and several userspace libraries and applications.

The Linux Kernel Media Subsystems provide support for devices like webcams, streaming capture and output, analog TV, digital TV, AM/FM radio, Sofware Digital Radio (SDR), remote controllers and encoders/decoders for compressed video formats. It offers native support for a large number of drivers for commonly available PCI cards and USB devices, but the subsystems are also targeted towards Linux based set-top-boxes and embedded devices like mobile phones. 

The main goal is to develop the Linux Kernel media subsystem.

We also develop a series of userspace applications, tools and libraries: v4l-utils, ZBar, Kaffeine, XawTv, TVtime, Camorama, EDID decode, Digital TV tables. While several applications are used primarely by end users, for the developers of the project, their primary goal is to be able to test the Kernel development and to provide userspace libraries to enhance the media subsystem support.
