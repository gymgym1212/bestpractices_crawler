-------

Exascale systems are scheduled to become available in 2018-2020 and will be
characterized by extreme scale and a multilevel hierarchical organization.

Efficient and productive programming of these systems will be a challenge,
especially in the context of data-intensive applications. Adopting the 
promising notion of Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming the
DASH project develops a data-structure oriented C++ template library that
provides hierarchical PGAS-like abstractions for important data containers
(multidimensional arrays, lists, hash tables, etc.) and allows a developer
to control (and explicitly take advantage of) the hierarchical data layout
of global data structures.

In contrast to other PGAS approaches such as UPC, DASH does not propose a
new language or require compiler support to realize global address space 
semantics. Instead, operator overloading and other advanced C++ features
are used to provide the semantics of data residing in a global and
hierarchically partitioned address space based on a runtime system with
one-sided messaging primitives provided by MPI or GASNet.

As such, DASH can co-exist with parallel programming models already in
widespread use (like MPI) and developers can take advantage of DASH by
incrementally replacing existing data structures with the implementation
provided by DASH. Efficient I/O directly to and from the hierarchical
structures and DASH-optimized algorithms such as map-reduce are also part
of the project. Two applications from molecular dynamics and geoscience
are driving the project and are adapted to use DASH.


Funding

DASH is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under the priority
programme ""Software for Exascale Computing - SPPEXA"" (2013-2018).",2016-11-18 11:09:33 UTC,2017-08-22 16:20:40 UTC,,,Met,"Several CI systems are used at different stages in development- and release processes.
DASH currently uses TravisCI and CircleCI as public infrastructures for continuous integration (3 build configurations x 3 test setups x 2 test environments).
