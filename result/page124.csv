This remains the case, and there will be no effort to unify the copyrights inside a single ""organization"", because those individual copyrights honor the authors who wrote those files.  The terms and conditions are not even 100% unified -- meaning there is a blend of Public Domain, ISC, 2-term BSD, and such, on different files, but all with equivalent copyright grants to the community.

23,4829,10351,firefit-rose-ap,"The present repository holds the FIREFIT Rose-AP components proposed by Introsys, S.A. which aim to easily integrate generic cameras and image classification processes into a Fiware solution, abstracting the user from concerns such as entity configuration, data persistence, device configuration or database configuration.

The first component, responsible for the cameras integration is the [Generic Camera Node (GCN)](#31-gcn-generic-camera-node).

The second component, responsible for the image classification is the [Image Classification Node (ICN)](#32-icn-image-classification-node).

Due to their [synergy](#4-synergy) it is possible to consider that any solution that implements both of the components is making use of a Vision-based Inspection System. Although this classification depends on the application, it is relevant in the context where Rose-AP stands, since it was designed as an answer to requirements and optimizations imposed and identified by the [FIREFIT experiment](http://www.dih-squared.eu/TTE-FIREFIT).
