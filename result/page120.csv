There are two issues: 
                1- While this new job compiles o-du-l2 module below error observed:
14:24:40 /w/workspace/o-du-l2-cmake-sonarqube/src/cm/cm_inet.c:128:10: fatal error: netinet/sctp.h: No such file or directory

To resolve this libsctp-dev should be installed.

                2- This job could not finish in default 15 mins time, so timeout parameter under build environment should be changed. (tried with 120)

Temporary solution applied:
Above issues resolved by putting below install command in shell script manually.
   sudo apt install -y libsctp-dev
                
For timeout changed timeout variable to 120.

An IoT Agent is a component that lets groups of devices send their data to and be managed from a FIWARE NGSI Context Broker using their own native protocols. IoT Agents should also be able to deal with security aspects of the FIWARE platform (authentication and authorization of the channel) and provide other common services to the device programmer.

“Remember to check both the linters and the tests before creating the Pull Request”",Met,"The set of tools used for examining code quality are listed in CONTRIBUTING.md.
The project uses eslint is used to look for problems in Javascript. The markdown documentation is scanned with remark and textlint. Docker files are scanned with Hadolint.",Met,In general warnings are addressed.

Each time a new pull request is created, the continuous integration system runs the test on it and it is ready to merge only when all tests pass ok. If a problem is found, feedback is provided via GitHub. In addition, several badges on top of the master README.md of the project provide information about the build status in the master branch.",,Met,GitHub supports discussions on issues and pull requests.,Met,"No valid private credentials appears in public repositories. When some usernames and/or passwords needs to be used, it is never included in repositories and proper mechanism (e.g. Docker secrets) are used at software building and deployment time.",Met,"All documentation is in English and the project accepts bug reports and comments in English.
