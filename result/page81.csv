All of Egeria's diagnostics use our Audit Log Framework (ALF) which is internationalized.  
https://egeria.odpi.org/open-metadata-publication/website/diagnostic-guide/

We do not provide translations.  However each log message and exception includes an English formatted message along with the parameter values and the message's unique message id.  The unique Id points to an externalized message specification which includes a description to the system action and user response.  This means a third party agent receiving these messages can translate them into another language if they have created the translated message specification.

This section is not marked complete because Egeria has 2 UIs and there has been no accessibility testing on them.
",Met,All messages go through the audit log framework that externalizes messages both for the audit log and for messages in exceptions.  Every message has a unique identifier. Values that are inserted in the messages are stored in the exception or audit log record to allow the message to be reformatted in multiple languages.
