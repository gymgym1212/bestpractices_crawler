16,3895,5270,preCICE,"preCICE (Precise Code Interaction Coupling Environment) is a coupling library for partitioned multi-physics simulations, including, but not restricted to fluid-structure interaction and conjugate heat transfer simulations. Partitioned means that preCICE couples existing programs (solvers) capable of simulating a subpart of the complete physics involved in a simulation. This allows for the high flexibility that is needed to keep a decent time-to-solution for complex multi-physics scenarios. preCICE runs efficiently on a wide spectrum of systems, from low-end workstations up to complete compute clusters and has proven scalability on 10000s of MPI Ranks.

The software offers methods for transient equation coupling, communication means, and data mapping schemes. preCICE is written in C++ and offers additional bindings for C, Fortran, Matlab, and Python. Ready-to-use adapters for well-known commercial and open-source solvers, such as OpenFOAM, deal.II, FEniCS, SU2, or CalculiX, are available.
