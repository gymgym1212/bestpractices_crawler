There is a need in next version of the project to implement our own handshake and token mechanism to prevent relay and replay attacks over the wire. That will use DH and TOTP as a basis though. Initial design can be seen here: https://heraldprox.io/specs/payload-secured,Met,Both our library and any dependencies will be Apache-2.0. OpenJDK implementations of core crypto features are available for Java primitives.,Met,"Met where applicable. Library adopters can configure a range of options, and plug in their own where needed.",Met,We follow NIST SP recommendations and NCSC recommendations.,Met,"This is the preferred approach but in an anonymous system there are limits to what can be achieved. E.g. for the 'simple payload' a daily key is used to forward generate the 5 minute expiring 'ephemeral keys' for digital contact tracing. This is a 'good thing', as less information needs to be transmitted across mobile networks for devices to realise they have had exposure to an ill person. The identity behind this daily key is not known, and only transmitted to devices after the event and after individuals have been diagnosed. (This is the same way GAEN works).
A new Secured Payload will provide this mechanism in a different way. This will use 'tokens' issued over an encrypted mechanism where this token is only exchanged with that device. This will be generated in such a way as to provide for perfect forward secrecy. (There will not be a common key basis to each token).",,"We don't store secrets. Where key storage features are used, we delegate this to the host OS. (E.g. it's managed in their secure enclaves, where available).",Met,"Used where provided by the host device. Where enough entropy is not provided (old Android phones), an external source of additional entropy is used to change the random bytes generated.",Met,"Source code: https and git+ssh source access. Builds on GitHub actions natively.
Bluetooth transfer: Only certain approaches possible with completely anonymous data exchange. New Secured Payload will issue tokens and hash responses from devices, so even if the originating transfer is MITM'ed, the resultant 'exposure' data would fail to be authenticated.",Met,Not done in our project,Met,"No confirmed vulnerabilities. All security mechanisms can also be replaced / switched out by downstream adopters of the library to more secure versions. Due to the wide range of android (SDK 21) and iOS (9.3+) devices we have to support, some options are more secure than others, but adopters can choose their preferred approach for all security functions.",Met,Only time this has been necessary the fix was issued within 24 hours of the project team being notified.,Met,"Spotbugs now part of the unit_test GitHub Actions workflow, and ran on every PR to the develop or master/main branches as a pre-requisite check.
