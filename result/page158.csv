The project can help you understand whether you are vulnerable to a specific vulnerability and explain to you what is the vulnerable component or invulnerable component in your system. The project can create a graph that presents the validation flow according to the vulnerability checks we perform. We want to create a community of researchers and programmers that can add vulnerability checks for new vulnerabilities or critical or famous vulnerabilities. Whenever a new vulnerability comes up, we can offer this service that helps people validate if they are vulnerable or not.
