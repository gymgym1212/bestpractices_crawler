13,1588,3192,ONAP VNFSDK,"ONAP VNFSDK's mission is to simplify the process of developing and onboarding VNFs and expanding ONAP's VNF ecosystem. For Service Providers, VNFSDK will reduce the time and level of testing required to identify, select, and onboard a VNF.  For vendors, VNFSDK will reduce integration efforts by defining a standard for VNF packaging with widespread operator acceptance.  VNFSDK can be used in a validation/conformance testing program in the future.

VNFSDK delivers automation tools for VNF product specification, packaging, publication and ingestion.
This project will also deliver a tool for: 

    package validation,
    lifecycle test (framework)
    functional test (framework)
