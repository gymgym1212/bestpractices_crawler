6,4746,9576,eve,"EVE-OS
EVE aims to develop an open, agnostic and standardized architecture unifying the approach to developing and orchestrating cloud-native applications across the enterprise on-premises edge. It offers users new levels of control through hardware-assisted virtualization of on-prem edge devices. Once installed, EVE has direct access to and control of underlying resources and provides standard APIs that allow more efficient use of resources and can effectively partition hardware to increase workload consolidation and application multi-tenancy.

EVE supports both ARM and Intel architectures and requires hardware-assisted virtualization. While EVE can run on a board as small as a $20 Orange Pi, the sweet spot for its deployment are IoT Gateways and Industrial PCs.

To get its job done, EVE leverages a lot of great open source projects: Xen Project, Linuxkit and Alpine Linux just to name a few. All of that functionality is being orchestrated by the Go microservices available under pkg/pillar. Why pillar? Well, because pillar is the kind of a monolith we need to break out into true, individual microservices under pkg/.",https://www.lfedge.org/projects/eve,https://github.com/lf-edge/eve,Apache-2.0,?,,Met,Given only https: URLs.,Met,"https://www.lfedge.org/projects/eve/
