All the programs share the same basic command-line user interface for the comfort of both the users and developers. Gnuastro is written to comply fully with the GNU coding standards so it integrates finely with the GNU/Linux operating system. This also enables astronomers to expect a fully familiar experience in the source code, building, installing and command-line user interaction that they have seen in all the other GNU software that they use.",https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro,https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gnuastro.git,GPL-3.0+,?,,Met,"All webpages are hosted by GNU and support HTTPS, this is the top page: https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/index.html",Met,"At the top of the software's main URL (https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuastro/), a short description is given.
