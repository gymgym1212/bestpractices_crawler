7,761,1063,High-performance WAF built on the OpenResty stack,"lua-resty-waf is a reverse proxy WAF built using the OpenResty stack. It uses the Nginx Lua API to analyze HTTP request information and process against a flexible rule structure. lua-resty-waf is distributed with a ruleset that mimics the ModSecurity CRS, as well as a few custom rules built during initial development and testing, and a small virtual patchset for emerging threats. Additionally, lua-resty-waf is distributed with tooling to automatically translate existing ModSecurity rules, allowing users to extend lua-resty-waf implementation without the need to learn a new rule syntax.

lua-resty-waf was initially developed by Robert Paprocki for his Master's thesis at Western Governor's University.
