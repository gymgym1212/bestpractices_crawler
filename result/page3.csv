PROJECTS
Create projects in SKF and start gathering requirements for your features/sprints

CODE EXAMPLES
An extensive library of common hacks, exploits, and best practices. Learn the hacker mindset and keep your project secure..

CHECKLISTS
Out of the box SKF comes with ASVS and MASVS included.

LABS
Train your hacking skills with over 50+ interactive labs that you can run locally or trough the SKF UI in your Kubernetes cluster.

KNOWLEDGE BASE
All requirements are correlated to knowledgebase items to give you more in depth information about attack vectors, impact, mitigation and best practices.

USER MANAGEMENT
Manage your users by adding linking SKF to your favourite OIDC provider

DESIGN PATTERNS
We included the most used user-stories in SKF to get your team get started quickly implementing ASVS in your projects.

SUPPORT
Find us on our Gitter channel to ask us anything about SKF and how to get yourself started.

The jar is signed by my private key. My public key is available from the MIT key server should anyone actually wish to confirm it. (Yeah; right. Sigh.),Unmet,"CVE-2013-5960 is still unfixed. NIST says that the CVSSv2 base score is 5.8 but I would contend that they did not take into account that one needs to convince the intended victim to first accept additional non-authenticated cipher modes and, place them in the ESAPI.properties file. Could happen, but that social engineering side was not taken into the equation.
Most Software Compositional Analysis tools / services (e.g., OWASP Dependency Check, BlackDuck, SourceClear, etc.) also flag ESAPI as being vulnerable to CVE-2019-17571 because it uses log4j 1.2.17. However, the ESAPI development team has examined this CVE and the ESAPI source code and do not believe that this CVE is exploitable in the manner that ESAPI is using it because we do not use the affected vulnerable class nor any log4j 1.x class that invokes the vulnerable class. We have deprecated the use of log4j 1.x in ESAPI and changed the default logger to JUL, but we are unable to remove this dependency without potentially breaking client code. Therefore we intend to follow our ESAPI deprecation policy and keep this dependency (even though it is past end-of-support) until either 2 years or until the next ESAPI major release (which would be ESAPI 3.0). We do not fell this is an issue because SLF4J is also supported and can be used to provide similar functionality.

Note that fixing this requires a medium redesign in the encrypt-then-MAC calculation. When I started looking at it more deeply, I realized there were additional things that should be MAC'd as well such as the version #, etc. (I since have become aware of Schneier & Ferguson's Horton Principle and am making design changes as a result.) Doing it securely in a manner that can be backward compatible is tough and it would be nice to have someone else with some applied cryptography knowledge since Jeffrey Walton is no longer contributing toward OWASP.",Met,"You'll get no argument from me. But given that ESAPI all but died (see https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API#tab=Should_I_use_ESAPI_3F and http://off-the-wall-security.blogspot.com/2014/03/esapi-no-longer-owasp-flagship-project.html), I'm happen that it's at least still crawling along.

With this in mind, the Security Group will work with the different OPNFV projects to assess their threat exposure, and what they can do to insure a secure code base.
