Its concept of Things facilitates the prototyping of live data prototypes.

Its concepts of Apps facilitate the prototyping of web and mobile data explorers, customised for the appropriate insights and reflections tasks. 

You acquire data through an App from data donation, crowdsourcing or landing pages; you collect data by prototyping an Arduino, Rasberry Pi or custom-based device that you land to participants; or you directly upload data from files. Then, you explore the harvested time series with a generic tool such as Grafana. You can export the data to use it in your prefered data tool at all times. Finally, you customise an App to explore and annotate with participants.

Data is strongly typed to facilitate transfer and automate processing. But you create you can create your types (e.g. data structures) adapted to your need.
