The CI/CV server executes all test before any release and the tests are public for al the contributors and users to use. 
",Met,The tests are public and main functionality is quite stable. Major changes that affect tests provoke the tests to be changed or they will fail and the release could not happen.  Just if the SW has been released it means it has been tested. ,Met,"In the ""Instructions for change requests"" the template of PR ask twice for the tests (https://github.com/Kurento/.github/blob/master/pull_request_template.md):

2. Checkbox indicating if new tests have been written. 
We usually evaluate those conditions as compulsory requirement. ",Met,"Kurento Releases are built firstly as .deb packages to be instaled in Debian/Ubuntu systems. The system tools which generate this files are also the ones activating all security mechanisms when compiling sources: (i) all warnings as errors, (2) memory safety ASLR and many other following the usual recomendations of binary compilings.

Thus we offer a custom Docker image with AddressSanitizer to users. Then in the case any user finds memory leaks the execution of this image in their specific use case will provide us (and all the community) with the results and can help us to solve the issue. ,Met,"We do but we deactivate all asserts for final builds each release because third party assertions -specifically libnice- were more than a 20% of reported crashes, However they are enabled for debug sessions and code analysis.
