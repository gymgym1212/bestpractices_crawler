20,2226,2931,Zowe - OpenSource for z/OS,"Zowe is a collection of technologies that make embracing the mainframe (z/OS) in a familiar way for those not familiar with it.  The technologies include REST APIs to enable CI/CD and system administration, a command-line interface that runs on the desktop (Mac, Linux, Windows) and a Desktop View that renders the mainframe in a familiar Desktop motif.

In addition to the core technologies, the project includes a variety of applications like TN3270, Z explorers for accessing files, submitting and retrieving job output as well as a communication framework to enable inter application communication.",https://zowe.org,https://github.com/zowe/zlc,EPL-2.0,?,,Met,Given only https: URLs.,Met,"Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through plug-ins and extensions that are created by clients or third-party vendors.

Zowe consists of the following main components.

zLUX: Contains a Web user interface (UI) that provides a full screen interactive experience. The Web UI includes many interactions that exist in 3270 terminals and web interfaces such as IBM z/OSMF.

Explorer server: Provides a range of APIs for the management of jobs, data sets, z/OS UNIX System Services files, and persistent data.

API Mediation Layer: Provides an API abstraction layer through which APIs can be discovered, catalogued, and presented uniformly.

Zowe CLI: Provides a command-line interface that lets you interact with the mainframe remotely and use common tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), shell commands, bash scripts, and build tools for mainframe development. It provides a set of utilities and services for application developers that want to become efficient in supporting and building z/OS applications quickly.https://zowe.org
