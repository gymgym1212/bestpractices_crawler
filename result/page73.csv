8,2786,3761,Predator: an open source performance testing platform for APIs,"Predator is a performance testing platform for APIs. It manages the entire lifecycle of load testing APIs, from creating and managing existing performance tests, to running these tests on a scheduled and on-demand basis, and finally viewing the test results in a highly informative and live built-in report.

Predator has a simple, one-click installation, built with support for Kubernetes (helm charts), DC/OS (mesosphere universe), and Docker Engine, and can persist the created performance tests and their reports in 5 different databases. It also supports running distributed load out of the box, enabling an unlimited amount of virtual users that can bombard your servers. Bootstrapped with a user-friendly UI alongside a simple REST API, Predator helps developers simplify the performance testing regime.
