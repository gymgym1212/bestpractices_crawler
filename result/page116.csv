Both mechanism support HTTPs. It is possible that individual users configure their delivery channel (e.g. the Pip package manager) to use an insecure HTTP connection, but that is not a standard configuration on recent versions of pip and thus out of scope.

https://pypi.org/project/data-attribute-recommendation-sdk/",Met,"Pip - which is the main delivery mechanism - does not enable hash checking by default: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#hash-checking-mode

If enabled, the mode works by having a local copy of the hashes against which pip will compare the hash of the downloaded component. The local copy of the hashes must be obtained via a separate channel, such as the Pypi.org website. Example: https://pypi.org/project/data-attribute-recommendation-sdk/0.7.1/#copy-hash-modal-b427bf5a-e3ad-4b2e-8b26-aab1e52b5d83

Since this website is reachable via HTTPS and implements a HTTP 301 redirect when accessed via plain non-encrypted HTTP, we can consider this requirement to be fulfilled.

The aspect relating to "" without checking for a cryptographic signature."" is also satisfied, as the browser verifies the certificate presented by Pypi.org.

There is no wide-spread support for package signing in the Python landscape, which is why we have not implemented dedicated package signing using a maintainer-specific key. See https://dzone.com/articles/package-signing-in-pip-it-works-in-a-roundabout-so

11,4520,8348,Orion Context Broker,"The Orion Context Broker is an implementation of the Publish/Subscribe Context Broker GE, providing an NGSI interface. Using this interface, clients can do several operations:

Query context information. The Orion Context Broker stores context information updated from applications, so queries are resolved based on that information. Context information consists on entities (e.g. a car) and their attributes (e.g. the speed or location of the car).
Update context information, e.g. send updates of temperature
Get notified when changes on context information take place (e.g. the temperature has changed)
Register context provider applications, e.g. the provider for the temperature sensor within a room
