It was ﬁrst conceived to allow for more genetic diversity for DNS server implementations used by the root-server system and it has been developed for operations in environments where speed, reliability, stability, and security are of high importance. NSD is currently used by a number of root servers operators, by top-level domain registries, ISPs, CDNs, and individuals.
