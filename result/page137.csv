It removes the work of finding, using, and monitoring the availability of the IoT devices around Kubernetes clusters. it provides an abstraction layer for device usage, handling the dynamic appearance and disappearance of IoT devices on the Edge.

An operator simply applies an Akri Configuration to a cluster, specifying the Discovery Handler (most commonly a protocol) that should be used to discover the devices, and the pod that should be deployed upon discovery. Then Akri does the rest.

An operator can also allow multiple nodes to use an IoT device, thereby providing high availability in the case where a node goes offline. Furthermore, Akri will automatically create a Kubernetes service for each type of device, removing the need for an application to track the state of pods or nodes.
