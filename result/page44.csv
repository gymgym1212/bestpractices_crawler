The AAI UI is a small eco-system that is composed of a few micro-services.
sparky-fe is the front end portion (and not captured in the current project)  
sparky-be is the web server that serves the front-end
data-router is responsible for reading messages on a queue from AAI and keep the secondary database in sync
search-data-service is an abstraction service that interacts with the secondary database
router-core is a library containing the core camel components for the data router
