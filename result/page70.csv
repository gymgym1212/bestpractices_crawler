There is a particular emphasis on formats and functionality used in professional, large-scale animation and visual effects work for film.  OpenImageIO is used extensively in animation and VFX studios all over the world, and is also incorporated into several commercial products. In addition to reading and writing many image formats, it also has an extensive set of functionality for image processing, out-of-core large image set management, a paging texture system, and many useful command line image utilities.",https://www.openimageio.org,https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio,BSD-3-Clause,?,,Met,"https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio
