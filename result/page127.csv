The Depalletization IoT Agent for RS232 and MODBUS TCP protocol is both infrastructural and functional component supporting warehousing and production (de)palletization processess. It provides data about (de)palletization processss performance automated by machines (e.g. approx. time remaining to finish a pile, number of remaining pile layers etc.)

An IoT Agent for RS232 and MODBUS TCP protocol is designed to be a bridge between RS232 ASCII based custom protocol or MODBUS TCP protocol and the NGSI interface of a context broker.

It is based on the IoT Agent Node.js Library. Further general information about the FIWARE IoT Agents framework, its architecture and the common interaction model can be found in the library's GitHub repository.",https://github.com/itti-pl/depalletization-agent-rose-ap,https://github.com/itti-pl/depalletization-agent-rose-ap,Apache-2.0,?,,Met,Given only https: URLs.,Met,https://github.com/itti-pl/depalletization-agent-rose-ap/blob/main/README.md,Met,https://github.com/itti-pl/depalletization-agent-rose-ap/blob/main/README.md,Met,"Projects on GitHub by default use issues and pull requests, as encouraged by documentation such as <https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/>.",?,,Met,https://github.com/itti-pl/depalletization-agent-rose-ap/blob/main/LICENSE,Met,The Apache 2.0 license is approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).
