The threat model of the project is to protect managed systems against an adversary gaining access to the system. Furthermore, if access can be gained to one of the systems, that system must not be able to compromise the Ansible controller which stores all configuration management state. It does not include the system administrator (user of the project) in the threat model (e. g. does not do extensive input validation). The system administrator is trusted in that he/she can compromise the security of the whole system.

Security by default is a goal of the project but the highest security must be sometimes explicitly enabled because enabling it by default is expected to limit functionality (example: [`sshd__paranoid`](https://github.com/debops/ansible-sshd/pull/22), refer to [ypid-ansible-inventory](https://github.com/ypid/ypid-ansible-inventory) which provides presets for this).

29,240,25,vim-metamath,"Vim-metamath is a vim mode for editing [metamath](http://us.metamath.org/) files.  [Metamath](http://us.metamath.org/) is a language that can express theorems in abstract mathematics, accompanied by proofs that can be rigorously verified by a computer program. Vim-metamath is a vim mode that provides immediate feedback while you're editing metamath files using the widely-used vim text editors. This mode should help you detect and fix defects before you even save your file. It is Free / libre / open source software, released under the MIT license.

Unlike marnix/metamath.vim mode, this vim mode is much more ambitious and strives to differentiate many different things. For example, it specially highlights different kinds of comments inside a comment area, and it colorizes certain operators differently. This creates a lot of visual differentiation that makes it easier to distinguish different kinds of information.

See the [Metamath Proof Explorer Home Page](http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html) to see final results generated from a file edited using vim-metamath. This work was inspired by Whitehead and Russell's monumental _Principia Mathematica_, and contains over 18,000 completely worked out proofs, starting from the very foundation that mathematics is built on and eventually arriving at familiar mathematical facts and beyond. Each proof is pieced together with razor-sharp precision using a simple substitution rule that practically anyone (with lots of patience) can follow, not just mathematicians. Every step can be drilled down deeper and deeper (as hyperlinks) into the labyrinth until axioms of logic and set theory - the starting point for all of mathematics - will ultimately be found at the bottom.  [Two plus two equals four](http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/2p2e4.html) actually goes quite deep, [because that builds on complex numbers which are first built up from more basic constructs](http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html#trivia).",https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/vim-metamath,https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/vim-metamath,MIT,?,,Met,Given only https: URLs.,Met,,Met,,Met,"Projects on GitHub by default use issues and pull requests, as encouraged by documentation such as <https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/>.",Met,"See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/vim-metamath/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the requirements for acceptable contributions.

Here are the changes to the project caused by the badging process, along with the time filling in the form.

Before even trying for the badge, I added automated testing because I knew that was required.  I think that's a *good* thing.

The first run through the form took about 20 minutes.  Three problems were found that prevented getting the badge:

* The information on how to contribute SHOULD include the requirements for acceptable contributions (e.g., a reference to any required coding standard). (URL required) [contribution_requirements]
* The project MUST have a unique version number for each release intended to be used by users. [version_unique]
* The project MUST provide, in each release, release notes that are a human-readable summary of major changes in that release. (URL required) [release_notes] 

It took maybe 20 minutes to adjust those, primarily to decide on a coding standard and adjust the code to match.

After adding those things, it took about 2 minutes to provide the additional information, for a total of 22 minutes to fill in the form.
