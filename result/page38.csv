Yed es un conjunto de programas útiles, muy sencillos y que nesecitan aún mucho desarrollo para sistemas UNIX/POSIX que interpreten comandos Bash, Sh, Zsh, Csh, etc. 
#### ¿Para qué sirve?
Los programas que incluye Yed tienen múltiples usos, pero están diseñados mayormente para tener contenido al alcance solamente con dos clicks.
#### ¿Cómo usarlo?
Para usar Yed **No es necesario compilar el código**, ya que lo interpreta el intérprete de Sh.
#### ¿Cómo contribuir?
Podés contribuir enviando nuevos programas o mejorando los existentes, ya qué es muy fácil.
#### ¿Cómo conseguir el código?
Para conseguir el código existen dos opcciones:
+ Clonar el repositorio: Para clonar el repositorio, ingrese en su terminal el siguiente comando:
