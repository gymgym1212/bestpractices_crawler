Anyway it wouldn't pass the Sonar quality gate at https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=io.github.jhipster.sample%3Ajhipster-sample-application,Met,The rule is at https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit,Met,We have a lint in our test suite at https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/tree/master/test - it's just not possible to pass the tests (that's the first test in our Travis test) if there is a lint error,,"We don't allow warnings, see the above section about the ""lint"", it can't go pass the tests, so the PR will not be processed",Met,We are very strict and don't allow them at all,Met,"I'm the lead developer so I'm the primary developer. I've got 20 years of experience, worked for several very high security systems (including several software for the French central bank), and I am a Java Champion (see https://community.oracle.com/community/technology_network_community/java/java-champions ).

FYI the algorithm is HMAC-SHA-512. This is done with the help of Okta, where Matt Raible and the lead JJWT developer both work.",Met,"See above, that's the case in https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/generators/server/templates/src/main/java/package/security/jwt/TokenProvider.java.ejs",Met,Yes https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt is FLOSS,Met,"That's provided by https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt - the library will fail if you provide a key which is too short.

And if the library fails our software does not start, of course.",Met,This is HMAC-SHA-512 and that's not broken yet,,"This doesn't make sense for us, this is for securing a webapp and the default validity for a key is 30 minutes...",Met,"Yes, when a password is stored, it is hashed with Bcrypt, see https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/4623dea96ad39d561732d422351674b11b415e4c/generators/server/templates/src/main/java/package/config/SecurityConfiguration.java.ejs#L193",Met,"We use the crypto function from NodeJS to generate the key, see https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/4a3184ae352cec0a26f696d75a4c34992552a654/generators/server/prompts.js#L288
