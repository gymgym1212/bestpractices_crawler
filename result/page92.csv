Jenkins core maintainers and the release team are also represented on the Security team.,Met,"The Jenkins project uses standard open-source implementations of cryptographic protocols and algorithms (e.g. implemented by JVM, Bouncy Castle, MINA SSH, and other open-source libraries like eddsa for its Ed25519 implementation). There are also standard APIs offered to the plugin developers (e.g. for [storing secrets](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/security/secrets/)).",Met,"The Jenkins core and its modules do not implement cryptography on their own in recent versions. They depend on open-source libraries which provide cryptography functions. There are historical cryptography APIs offered in Jenkins, but their internal implementations have been replaced by open-source cryptography libraries used in the project.

Additional notes about previous releases that are no longer supported:

* Jenkins Remoting layer used to implement encryption on its own in the JNLP3 protocol. This protocol was deprecated in Dec 2017 ([Remoting 3.15](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#315)) and then completely removed from the codebase in Dec 2019 ([Remoting 3.40](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/releases/tag/remoting-3.40))
* The Jenkins core used to include cryptography implementations, e.g. a Jenkins-specific fork of the abandoned Trilead SSH library. It was removed from [Jenkins 2.186](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-old/#v2.186) in July 2019 and is only included as detached plugin for backward compatibility with plugins depending on it, but not used by Jenkins itself.
",Met,"Jenkins core is fully FLOSS, as well as its dependencies.
",Met,"The Jenkins core generally does not manage the key lengths in the codebase. We use the default values provided by the recent versions of cryptography libraries. One of the exceptions is a CryptoConfidentialKey used in `hudson.util.Secret` and a few other locations. These occurrences use AES 128 by default, and it is compliant with the length requirement for symmetric keys.",Met,"We do NOT use broken cryptography algorithms for security mechanisms inside the Jenkins core or modules. In some cases MD5 is used to produce unique keys for Jenkins objects which are not used in a security context. Such objects have soft uniqueness requirements, and potential collisions do not compromise the Jenkins security or sensitive data.",Met,"In the majority of use-cases we use the default forward secrecy provided by 3rd-party open-source libraries (e.g. for establishing SSH connections). Same for HTTPS, the entire implementation is supplied by external libraries or projects (e.g. Eclipse Jetty bundled in the Jenkins core and used as a default web container).

The only exception is the [Jenkins Remoting](https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting) library that includes an implementation of the JNLP4-connect protocol for networking between the Jenkins server and agents. This protocol uses the standard TLS encryption layer provided by JVM (default version). As of Jenkins 2.235.1 LTS Jenkins supports Java 8 (TLS 1.2 by default, no TLS 1.3 implementation in OpenJDK) and Java 11 (TLS 1.2 or 1.3 are provided). TLS 1.2 does not enforce perfect forward secrecy by default, but users of Jenkins can enforce TLS 1.3 and forward secrecy with OpenJDK 11 or with other JVMs for Java 8/11. Jenkins admins can also elect to block the JNLP4-connect protocol over TCP, and to use the WebSocket connection over HTTP/HTTPS, in which case the encryption is delegated to the web server and reverse proxies.
",Met,"In Jenkins we provide a private security realm which stores password hashes in the local filesystem database. This implementation uses BCrypt, and hence it is compatible with the requirements. It is also possible to use external authentication services (e.g. LDAP) which do not store user passwords in Jenkins. [Jenkins Security Realm documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/security/#security-realm)
",Met,In the Jenkins core and modules we use the standard secure random number generator provided by the JVM. There are no custom implementations within the codebase.,Met,"The Jenkins project uses HTTPS for the entire infrastructure and delivery mechanisms with the exception of Update Center Mirrors (tracked as [INFRA-266](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-266)). Mirrors are used to deliver Jenkins core, native packages and plugin binaries. 

* For the Jenkins WAR file distributions, checksums for current releases can be retrieved from the https://jenkins.io/download/ page. Additionally, the war files are signed and can be checked using jarsigner.
* All official Jenkins native packages and installers are signed by the project, and this signature can be verified upon delivery by using a package manager.
* To ensure that the delivered plugins are not tampered, the Jenkins project provides SHA-256 checksums which are accessible over HTTPS from the [Update Center JSON file](https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json) which is retrieved over HTTPS in the default configuration. In addition to that, the JSON file itself is signed using SHA-512. Jenkins verifies the checksums upon download of plugins in the update center client logic.

Jenkins users can also set up a pure HTTPS delivery for all Jenkins artifacts by deploying their own update center by using the [update center generator](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2) provided by the Jenkins project. This generator downloads all artifacts and metadata from the [Jenkins Maven repository](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/) over HTTPS.

In addition to plugins and distributions, Jenkins update sites also list downloadable tools supplied by plugins (e.g. Maven, Gradle, AdoptOpenJDK). These tools are downloaded from external locations which may not implement the secure delivery chain as we depend on other projects serving files securely (tracked as [JENKINS-55659](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-55659)). Such tool downloads are opt-in, none of the tools are enabled and installed by default. The Jenkins project does not provide guarantees for external tool downloads.
",Met,"Jenkins cryptographic hashes are retrieved over HTTPS from the [Jenkins Maven repository](https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/). Checksums are also accessible over HTTPS from the [Update Center JSON file](https://updates.jenkins.io/current/update-center.actual.json) which is retrieved over HTTPS by default (since 2017) and additionally, a signature for itself in a canonical form is included and verified by Jenkins.
",Met,"There are no such vulnerabilities in the Jenkins Core and modules. While we strive to keep library dependencies updated, some dependencies included in the Jenkins core have known vulnerabilities. In such cases, we determine whether these vulnerabilities are exploitable in Jenkins, and if so, address them. Otherwise we do not consider these to be vulnerabilities in Jenkins.

There are some unpatched vulnerabilities in plugins as listed in [security advisories](https://jenkins.io/security/advisories/), but plugins are not in the scope for this certification. In the case of high severity issues the plugins are usually delisted from the Jenkins update centers. In all cases, warnings are presented to administrators of Jenkins instances that have plugins with publicly known vulnerabilities installed.
",Met,"Critical vulnerabilities in the Jenkins core are handled by the [Jenkins Security Team](https://jenkins.io/security/#team). This team reviews all incoming reports and prioritizes and fixes them. Critical vulnerabilities are prioritized as a top priority, and additional subject-matter experts may be involved if needed. For example, in 2015 the Jenkins project was able to analyze and fix the [public class deserialization attack disclosure](https://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/) earlier than all other affected projects/vendors. In addition to that, we published a [mitigation guide](https://jenkins.io/blog/2015/11/06/mitigating-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-0-day-in-jenkins-cli/) within less than 24 hours after the announcement.",Met,"We use SpotBugs, Animal Sniffer, Maven Enforcer Plugin as a part of the build/release pipelines",Met,"Jenkins project is being regularly scanned by various static analysis tools, including tools like [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) or [Anchore](https://anchore.com/). [GitHub Security](https://github.com/security) is also used for dependency scanning and reporting. Also, Jenkins users regularly run static code analysis tools against the codebase/distributions and then report the results. In addition to that, there is ongoing discussion about including [FindSecBugs detectors](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/exd3fc9NUAg/gwTmoXB9AAAJ) into standard Pipelines.",Met,"In the Jenkins core there were several security issues reported by dependency scanning tools. They were timely analyzed and fixed if the vulnerability was confirmed. So far we did not get any confirmed medium/high severity vulnerabilities reported by a static code analysis tool.

Some Jenkins users run scans and sometimes report vulnerabilities to the project, but it is quite rare.",,"Jenkins project does not include code written using a memory-unsafe language. We use some 3rd-party dependencies which include native code, e.g. [Windows Process Management Library](https://github.com/kohsuke/winp) written in C. This library is provided by a third party, and it is not in the scope for this certification.",Met,"Jenkins project does not use dynamic analysis tools as a part of the CI/CD pipeline. On the other hand, Jenkins instances produce run-time events (logs, metrics, etc.) which are exposed to monitoring tools and can be used for dynamic analysis",,We do not use dynamic analysis tools as a part of our CI/CD pipeline,,2019-12-26 14:21:18 UTC,2020-07-22 09:53:41 UTC,Met,"Jenkins core generally does not rely on SHA-1 for security purposes. The only security-related use of SHA-1 in the Jenkins core is related to the validation of downloaded plugins and Jenkins .war files from update sites. This is only used as a fallback if the update site does not provide SHA-256 or SHA-512 checksums, and a warning is logged. Official Jenkins update sites have provided these better checksums since April 2018, so this only matters for third-party unofficial update sites, and only if downloads are not delivered via HTTPS.

CBC mode is not used by the Jenkins core, and the algorithm is removed from the SSHD Module which implements the SSH server side logic in Jenkins.

Note: In some cases we use AES encryption with default settings provided by JVM, without explicit padding and mode specification. This results in ECB usage in some circumstances in the case of the default JVM configuration. ECB is not optimal due to data correlation analysis weakness, but it is not considered as a serious weakness for short data objects. Jenkins users have an option to change the JVM defaults to enforce strong cryptography and other default AES modes.
