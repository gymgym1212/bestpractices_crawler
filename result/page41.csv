4,1614,2096,ONAP POLICY,"POLICY is the subsystem of ONAP that maintains, distributes, and operates on the set of rules that underlie ONAP’s control, orchestration, and management functions.

POLICY provides a logically centralized environment for the creation and management of policies, including conditional rules. This provides the capability to create and validate policies/rules, identify overlaps, resolve conflicts, and derive additional policies as needed.

Policies are used to control, influence, and help ensure compliance with goals. Policies can support infrastructure, products and services, operation automation, and security. Users, including network and service designers, operations engineers, and security experts, can easily create, change, and manage policy rules from the POLICY Manager in the ONAP Portal.

A policy is defined to create a condition, requirement, constraint, decision, or a need that must be provided, evaluated, maintained, and/or enforced. The policy is validated and corrected for any conflicts, and then placed in the appropriate repository, and made available for use by other subsystems and components. Alternately, some policies are directly distributed to policy decision engines such as Drools or XACML. In this manner, the constraints, decisions and actions to be taken are distributed.",https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Policy+Framework+Project,https://gerrit.onap.org/r/admin/repos/policy/parent,Apache-2.0,?,,Met,"The project sites are all HTTPS:

For Policy Project, each release has documentation on how to develop with the software:

So we can access all old versions of the artifact. If and when a upgrade requires certain steps to be followed they are being added to the release documents as needed,Met,"Vulnerabilities can be reported using the link

There are no bi-directional cross-dependencies between submodules.,Met,"All releases are tagged in gerrit(git), and the builds are controlled using jenkins. By providing the git tag information the same image can be build over and over again with same bit-for-bit result.",Met,The compiled docker images and jar files can be installed/used as the user sees fit. Both run on JVM or docker. So there is no reason to select locations etc.,Met,"All the components require only java and maven to begin with for a developer to quickly install and test it.
Even for deployment using OOM and the right amount of resources, we can deploy the full Policy/ONAP suite in less than a day. The steps are documented in
https://docs.onap.org/projects/onap-oom/en/latest/oom_quickstart_guide.html",Met,"External dependencies are controlled using the pom file, which can be found in the root folder for the projects. We store most of our common dependencies in our policy/parent project's pom.xml:

The user can get a list of all included components using the maven dependency tree and can update or reuse as they see fit,Met,"We avoid depending on deprecated/obsolete functions.  Sonar scans, which are run daily, identify the use of deprecated functions.",Met,Automatic test suites are run every time before merging the code. The code check in cannot pass with out jenkins posting a +1 on the review.,Met,We require JUnit tests to be added to support bug fixes if they are not present.,Met,"We use sonar to measure the overall code/branch coverage.
