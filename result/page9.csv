The official Git repository can be found here:
[gitlab.com/tshack/kaze](https://gitlab.com/tshack/kaze)

Currently, Kaze provides:

  * A robust dynamic module system.  The Kaze library itself is a
    lightweight runtime system. Functionality is provided and extended
    by Kaze modules, which can be built directly into Kaze or loaded
    into the library at runtime.  Applications linking against Kaze can
    add support for additional file types and introduce new algorithms
    after release by shipping out modules to users.  Modules can be
    written in either C or C++.

  * A modular algorithm system called _Kaze Blocks_.  Kaze Blocks are
    built on top of Kaze's dynamic module system and can be distributed
    as files, which are loadable at runtime.  Kaze Blocks provide
    standardized interfaces for setting algorithm options and marshaling
    data.  With little effort, algorithm modules can be strung together
    to build powerful pipelines.

  * A reference based memory management system, which facilitates
    complicated workflows where object ownership may change or be
    managed across multiple threads of execution.

  * An N-dimensional image type providing mutable pixel buffers,
    in-place pixel type conversion, unlimited channels, and smart
    pixel iteration.

  * Beautifully detailed API documentation and author guides.

  * An ever increasing inventory of Kaze Blocks and file I/O modules!",https://www.libkaze.org,https://gitlab.com/tshack/kaze,MIT,?,,Met,Given only https: URLs.,Met,Kaze is a scientific image processing library written in C.,Met,"https://gitlab.com/tshack/kaze/issues
